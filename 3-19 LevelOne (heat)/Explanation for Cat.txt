Here's the explanation of what files are comparable to what files:

spriteBitAnimation.c ~ mainSprite.c
changes:    no more "main.c" function
            width of Bit has changed
            removed performantDelay function
            created "joypadDetection" and "heatJoypadDetection" functions
                note: the former is for general movement, the latter is for the heat combat level
            ...possibly more, but I don't see any.
            
GameCharacter.c ~ GameCharacter.c
changes:    added a new "enemyCharacter" struct, to be used for the heat enemy character.

LevelOne: This is the level design of the heat level.
It requires:
A colorful background (preferably scrolling downwards)
colorful heat sprites (see below),
and also needs a message to appear at the end of main.c, letting them know if they've won or lost.

heat.gbr:
This is the heat enemy tileset. Currently without any colors, and I don't know how to implement the colors
to be honest, as I didn't really examine the Bit code that closely.
